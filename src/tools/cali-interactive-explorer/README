Basic use
=====================

To launch

  python -i __init__.py --inputs [caliper_files]

From here, two main commands exist, "query" and "graph"

"Query" queries the Caliper files you ran this against and stores the results in a Pandas dataframe (note: please omit "FORMAT" arguments from queries)

"Graph" similarly queries the files, except it also plots the end results. Imaginging you had a pile of profiles each with a different Caliper-annotated value for "num_particles", you could graph the times of your functions by

graph("select time.inclusive.duration group by function,num_particles where function,num_particles")

This usage will quickly change as the software is improved
